The gcc error parser gets an incorrect error message when it is preceded by a contextual information using the following syntax "In file included from <file1>\n from <file2>\n [...] from <fileN>".
example:
In file included from /usr/include/c++/4.4/backward/hash_set:59,
from ../../../../extlibs/miniBoost/boost/graph/adjacency_list.hpp:25,
from Node.cpp:50:
/usr/include/c++/4.4/backward/backward_warning.h:28:2: warning: #warning This file includes at least one deprecated or antiquated header which may be removed without further notice at a future date. Please use a non-deprecated interface with equivalent functionality instead. For a listing of replacement headers and interfaces, consult the file backward_warning.h. To disable this warning use -Wno-deprecated.

The message matched by the regular expression starts at: " from Node.cpp:50:".
I ran the regexp in a text editor and it seems to be matching these 2 lines, which is obviously wrong:
from Node.cpp:50:
/usr/include/c++/4.4/backward/backward_warning.h:28:2: warning: #warning This file includes at least one deprecated or antiquated header which may be removed without further notice at a future

The reported error is set to high priority and details look like this:
File: from Node.cpp, Line: 0, Type: gcc, Priority: High, Category: GCC error
